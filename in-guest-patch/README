Checking ptrace protection 

	https://wiki.ubuntu.com/SecurityTeam/Roadmap/KernelHardening#ptrace_Protection

Compiling a library

	sudo gcc -shared -fPIC patch.c -o patch.so -ldl -static-libstdc++

Attach to process

	sudo gdb -ex "attach $(pidof test)"

Load a library

	set $dlopen = (void*(*)(char*, int)) dlopen
	set $library = $dlopen("/home/muscatmat/Programming/process_patching/patch.so", 1)
	continue

Unload a library

	set $dlclose = (int(*)(void*)) dlclose
	call dlclose($library)
	continue

Reload a library
	
	set $dlopen = (void*(*)(char*, int)) dlopen
	call dlclose($library)
	set $library = $dlopen("/home/muscatmat/Programming/process_patching/patch.so", 1)
	continue

Autoload library symbols
	show auto-solib-add
	sharedLibrary

Set hooked functions plt (due to 64 bit)
	set *(int64_t *)0x601028 = <EXIT GOT ADDR> // 0x601030 is exit GOT, cast address to (int64_t *) to set to a 64 bit addresses
	set *(int64_t *)0x601018 = <PUTS GOT ADDR>


Loading/Unloading a library through libc

	set $dlopen = (void*(*)(char*, int)) __libc_dlopen_mode
	set $dlclose = (int(*)(void*)) __libc_dlclose

	set $library = $dlopen("/home/muscatmat/Programming/process_patching/patch.so", 1)
	call $dlclose($library)
	continue

IMP:
	Requires redirection of GOT to shared library appropriate function
	Check missing debug info for shared library
